                <p>
                  You can control communications such as bulletins and other
                  information about your chosen services by following the
                  unsubscribe instructions in the communication or by simply
                  replying and inserting “Unsubscribe” in the subject line.
                  You may still receive other communications that are
                  relevant to your chosen services but do not relate to that
                  specific type of communication. Where this is the case,
                  you will be able to unsubscribe from these communications
                  in the same way.
