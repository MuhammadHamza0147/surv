                              First established in 2013, Surveillance UK is
                              new to 2023 in name only. Our founder and a
                              leading agent from the start, took some time
                              away from the world of ‘spying’ and catching
                              cheating husbands and cheating wives, to
                              concentrate on his new family and children.
                              Although, away from the game, he never
                              actually really left, keeping in touch with
                              the network of agents and operatives he built
                              up over the years.

                            <p>
                              With his children grown up, the increase seen
                              in a lack of professionalism and laziness
                              contributing to poor results for vulnerable
                              clients opened the door for Surveillance UK to
                              be re-ignited. Like a phoenix from the ashes!

                              Today, we combine our years of legacy and

                              in the UK and across the globe. From brains to
                              boots, we purposefully infuse integrity,
                              vigilance, and excellence into our work. Our

                              implementation. No matter when, no matter
                              where, we pride ourselves on being there for
